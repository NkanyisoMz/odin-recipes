    <p>These are flat cake made of thin batter and cooked (as on a griddle) on both sides.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 â…› cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat and lightly grease a large skillet or electric griddle.</li>
        <li>Mix flour, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl. Add egg, buttermilk, and butter; stir together lightly, but keep it lumpy. The batter should look thick, spongy, and puffy.</li>
        <li>Drop 1/3 cup of the batter onto the cooking surface, spreading lightly with the bottom of the cup. Cook until lightly browned on each side, 1 to 2 minutes per side.</li>
    </ol>
